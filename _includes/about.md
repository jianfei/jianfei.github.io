### Who am I

Hi, this is Jianfei from China. <br />
I am a front-end web developer with 10+ years experiences. <br />
I worked at SEA (the largest tech company in Southeast Asia), Alibaba. Now I am a team leader in a start-up company.

### Why having this blog?

There are several reasons:
- After 10 years of working, I'd like to share some thoughts and experiences regarding web development.
- Making more friends from overseas. And share some of the interesting facts about China.
- I am not a native English speaker. I use this blog to improve my English writing skills.

### I am looking for a job

I works in China now. But I am looking for a working opportunity to relocate to Dublin / London for family reasons. <br />
Leave me a message if you have open positions, I will send you my CV and discuss more on the position.

### Contact me
